                        <p>Cranham is an ancient parish bounded by Upminster on the west, and North Ockenden on the
                            south.
                            In the Middle Ages Cranham was more often known as Bishop's Ockenden since its chief manor
                            was
                            held by the bishop of London, but from the 15th century it was usually called Cranham.

                            Domesday figures show Cranham as small and heavily wooded, but from the 15th century the
                            process
                            of forest clearance was advancing. Mixed farming, with arable predominating, became the
                            economic
                            mainstay of the parish throughout this time and into the 19th century. The population grew
                            in
                            the 19th century and there were 340 people living in farms or cottages in 1851.

                            After the Second World War Cranham became a commuter suburb of London, with livery stables
                            and
                            riding schools largely replacing sheep and dairy farming.

                            North Ockendon is a small country parish whose medieval name, 'Ockenden Setfountayns',
                            derived
                            from the lords of the manor, the Setfountayn family who acquired the manor in the 1200s.
                            Settlement in the area was established in the Middle Ages, with a central village and a few
                            outlying farms.

                            Little has changed in the makeup of the parish over time, with farming remaining the main
                            occupation. A mill once stood in North Ockendon, but was demolished in 1840. Among the many
                            surviving buildings of historic interest are The Old Bakehouse, The Forge, both
                            timber-framed
                            buildings that were built on the Ockendon Road in the 17th century, and a rectory house that
                            was
                            rebuilt in 1750. North Ockendon Hall was destroyed during WWII, but its medieval moat is now
                            part of Hall Farm flower nursery.

                            In the 19th century some agricultural land was turned over to market gardening, and then
                            some to
                            gravel extraction by the middle of the 20th century.

                            The village became part of Hornchurch Urban District in the 1930s, and then the London
                            Borough
                            of Havering in 1965.</p>

                        <h2>Some People and Places in the Cranham & North Ockendon Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            General James Oglethorpe was a politician, social reformer and military leader. In 1722 he
                            successfully ran for Parliament, and in 1729 he campaigned for prison reform in England. He
                            had
                            a long and varied career, which included founding the North American colony of Georgia in
                            1731.
                            After many years abroad he met heiress Elizabeth Wright on a return visit to England in
                            1744.
                            They married and lived at her inherited estate, Cranham Hall, until his death in 1785.

                            Cranham Hall, The Chase, Cranham. Whilst it is known that there was a house on the site of
                            Cranham Hall in about 1600, it was demolished in about 1789, and the present house on the
                            site
                            dates from around 1800. The nearby All Saints Church, was built in 1873, but an original
                            church
                            on the site was recorded in 1310. There is a commemorative tablet to General Oglethorpe, one
                            of
                            the Hall's most notable inhabitants, on its south wall.

                            The Church of St Mary Magdalene in Church Lane, North Ockendon, was built prior to 1075 on a
                            site dating back to c630, but after many alterations through the centuries, only the south
                            doorway of the church now dates from this time. The chancel dates from the 14th century, and
                            the
                            pulpit from the 17th century. There was further restoration and improvements made in the
                            19th
                            century.

                            Stubbers has a documented history dating back to 1334, although only the garden wall remains
                            from the original mansion. The estate was named after William Stubbers, a yeoman farmer who
                            had
                            formed it between 1438 and 1463. Humphrey Repton, the great late Georgian landscape designer
                            provided designs for Stubbers in 1796, detailing them in one of the trademark Red Books (so
                            named for their red morocco binding) which he presented to his clients. The Red Book for
                            Stubbers still exists, and is held by the Essex Record Office.

                            William Coys the famous botanist, lived at Stubbers, North Ockendon, until his
                            death in 1627. He cultivated many unusual species in his walled gardens, and established one
                            of
                            the earliest plant collections recorded in England. A hundred years later many of the plants
                            from Stubbers were used to establish Kew Gardens.

                        <p> Evidence of a Romano-British farmstead, said to have been occupied during the 1st and 3rd
                            centuries, was discovered west of Corbets Tey during gravel digging in Upminster in 1962. In
                            medieval Upminster, settlement seems to have been in three clusters: the village itself, and
                            the
                            hamlets of Hacton and Corbets Tey, which expanded slowly, with a few scattered farms being
                            built
                            at the north and south ends
                            of the parish. Although it was completely rebuilt in 1861-62, St Laurence's church on the
                            Corbets Tey Road retains a tower with stonework dating to around 1200, and it is believed a
                            church may have existed on or near this site as early as the 7th century.

                            There were three manors recorded in Upminster in 1086, the largest of which, originally
                            known as
                            the manor of Upminster, was later known as Gaynes, or Engaynes, after Vitalis Engayne who
                            acquired it in 1214. New Place began as part of the Gaynes estate in 1556, but in 1775 a new
                            house was built on the site by Sir James Esdaile, who developed several of the houses in
                            Upminster. He added a clock turret, which came from Woolwich Arsenal, to the roof of the
                            stable
                            block. It houses a clock made in 1774 by famous London clock maker, Edward Tutet. New Place
                            itself was demolished in 1924, but the stable block remained and is known today as the
                            Clockhouse.

                            The third manor of Upminster, also known as Waltham Upminster and Upminster Hall, was gifted
                            to
                            the college (later abbey) of Waltham Holy Cross in the 9th century by Earl Harold. It is
                            said
                            that today the ghosts of the monks can be glimpsed in a tree walk in the nearby playing
                            fields
                            that were part of the estate! The manor saw many changes in ownership over the years until
                            1686
                            when it was bought by Andrew Branfil, and it remained in his family until the early 20th
                            century. Today it is home to the Upminster Golf Club.

                            The economic history of Upminster has chiefly been that of mixed agriculture, with an
                            upsurge in
                            market-gardening in the 19th century. This agricultural heritage is evidenced in two fine
                            monuments still to be seen today. As well as Upminster Windmill of 1803, there is Upminster
                            Barn
                            (also known as Upminster 'Tithe' Barn), which is thought to have been built in the early
                            15th
                            century, and was used as a threshing barn. Both are now heritage attractions open to the
                            public.

                        <p>
                            Upminster Windmill stands on Upminster Hill and was built by local farmer James Nokes in
                            1803.
                            It is the largest smock mill remaining in the London area, and considered to be one of the
                            finest examples. It is now open to the public as a heritage attraction.
                            Alice Perrers lived at Gaynes Manor, Upminster. She died there in 1400 after a life of great
                            notoriety. She was married to Sir William of Windsor, Viceroy of Ireland, but was also the
                            notorious mistress of Edward III. Her influence over the king led to accusations of
                            witchcraft
                            in 1376.
                            William Derham was vicar of Upminster from 1689 to 1735. A natural philosopher, and the
                            author
                            of many research papers, he is credited with producing the earliest, reasonably accurate
                            estimate of the speed of sound. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1702, and lived
                            in
                            High House until his death in 1735.
                            Lady Edna Clarke Hall, an artist and poet, lived in Great House, a 16th century farmhouse in
                            Upminster. She studied at the Slade School of Art in 1895-9 and had several exhibitions from
                            1901 onwards. Several of her drawings are held in the Tate Gallery. She died in 1979, aged
                            100.
                            Henria Williams lived in Upminster and was active in the Suffragette movement. In a march on
                            the
                            House of Commons in 1910 there was a disturbance that would become known as 'Black Friday'.
                            Many
                            protesters, including Williams, were badly injured by police. Sadly, Williams died suddenly
                            two
                            months later from heart failure.
                            Ian Dury, painter, musician and actor was born in Harrow in 1942, but after his parents
                            separated he moved with his mother to Cranham. He reflected his teenage Teddy boy life
                            around
                            Upminster in the song 'Upminster Kids,' and titled one of his albums 'Lord Upminster'.</p>

                            First recorded in 969AD as 'Winintuna', there is a suggestion that Wennington was named for
                            the
                            Saxon chief, Wynna. It is a small, ancient marshland village bounded on the west and north
                            by
                            Rainham, and east by the village of Aveley, and south by the Thames. Its boundary with
                            Aveley
                            was being disputed in the 19th century but ultimately settled in 1842.

                            A manor house existed in 1198, known as Wennington Westminster or Wennington Hall, and the
                            church of St Mary and St Peter was also built about this time. The church stands on a ridge
                            of
                            land across the marshes, and is the only remaining medieval building in the village,
                            although it
                            has seen many changes and alterations. The 12th century doorway remains but most of the
                            present
                            church dates from the 13th century, and the tower from the 15th century. It is believed
                            there
                            had also been a Saxon church on this site, and a church is officially recorded in Wennington
                            in
                            1042-1044 when Edward the Confessor confirmed the parish as belonging to Westminster Abbey.

                            In 1066, the recorded population of Wennington had been eight, but by 1670 there were twelve
                            houses, and by 1801 there were 91 recorded inhabitants. In the 1880s, when wealthy Rainham
                            industrialists chose to live in Wennington, some prosperity came to the area and the
                            population
                            began to rise, but Wennington remained a rural parish, with agriculture as its main
                            occupation
                            and pasture land predominant.

                            Market gardening had become well established by about 1841, and Wennington was producing
                            large
                            quantities of vegetables, especially peas for the London market. From 1865 onwards, several
                            factories and manufacturers tried to set up in Wennington but with less success. Firstly,
                            the
                            Fresh Meat Preserving Company was founded, but passed to James Ingram & Sons, india-rubber
                            manufacturers, just one year later. In 1881 chemical manufacturers, John Kidd & Company,
                            took
                            over, and they also built a coffee house c1882, which survived until 1973. They leased the
                            factory in 1885 to the Camden Marine Steam laundry, but it burnt down in 1891.

                            Wennington was part of Hornchurch Urban district from 1934, until it became part of Havering
                            in
                            1965.

                            2019 the Havering Hoard was discovered in Wennington during an archaeological survey prior
                            to a
                            new gravel pit being opened up. The 453 pieces of bronze was the largest hoard discovered in
                            London and the third .

                        <p>Henry of Yevele was a medieval master-mason and architect who held lands in Wennington. He
                            was
                            involved in work on the Bloody Tower in the Tower of London, and the naves of Westminster
                            Abbey
                            and Canterbury Cathedral

                            Wennington Hall has a history dating back to the Domesday Book. It was held by Edward the
                            Confessor in the 11th century, and in the 14th century by Henry of Yevele, who served as
                            Speaker
                            in two Parliaments of Richard II. However, Wennington Hall has been rebuilt and undergone
                            many
                            alterations, and is today a modern 20th century building.

                            Nicholas Brady was rector in Wennington in the late 19th century, and lived at Rainham Hall.
                            He
                            compiled careful notes on the history of the parish, and took the lead in the social life of
                            Wennington, encouraging concerts, magic lantern shows and glee clubs, mostly centred at the
                            newly built school.

                            Wennington School was built in 1887 adjoining the church. Until then, children had been
                            taught
                            in private houses, and in a thatched cottage in Church Lane that had been owned by the
                            churchwardens. The cottage has since been demolished, and the school was converted into
                            three
                            dwellings in 1966.

                            Henry Perigal, a bookkeeper and eccentric amateur mathematician, was a descendent of a
                            Huguenot
                            family which had immigrated to England in the 17th century. His life spanned almost the
                            entire
                            19th century. Although he wrote on many subjects, he is primarily known for providing proof
                            for
                            the Pythagorean Theorem in his booklet, Geometric Dissections and Transpositions, the
                            details of
                            which are recorded on his memorial in the churchyard of St Mary & St Peter. He was a member
                            of
                            the London Mathematical Society, treasurer of the Royal Meteorological Society, a fellow of
                            the
                            Royal Astronomical Society, and, at the age of 94, he became a member of the Royal
                            Institution.
                            Did you know? A reformatory ship, called the Cornwall, was moored at nearby Purfleet in
                            1859? It
                            could accommodate up to 250 boys who had been committed to detention for more than three
                            years.
                            Some terraced houses for its staff were built in Wennington, as well as a large laundry. We
                            have
                            a reminder that the laundry once stood here in the name of Laundry Cottages on Wennington
                            Road.

                            Early signs of human occupation in Romford include a possible British camp in the Marshalls
                            area
                            and bronzesmith's hoard. Later the area was the site of a Roman staging post called
                            Durolitum.
                            Romford's economy relied on the intersection of major transport routes from an early date.

                            The Middle Ages saw the growth of this small hamlet into a market town. The leather industry
                            which originated in Hornchurch found a ready market in the number of travellers using the
                            old
                            Roman road to Colchester. In 1247, the fledgling market received a royal grant from Henry
                            III,
                            and continues to this day. The existence of the market created a cluster of buildings over
                            the
                            centuries, many of them inns catering for the travellers along the Great Essex Road, and the
                            many visitors to the market.

                            A further boost was given to Romford when improved toll roads were introduced, heralding the
                            rise of the coaching age, where stops were made along the way. Romford now had a very large
                            number of inns and other facilities to cater for the coaches; it even had fashionable shops
                            catering to the gentry and the new professional classes who were setting up in Romford. It
                            was
                            also on the route of itinerants who travelled around the country making a scant living by
                            selling various wares or performing - the type of character seen in Victorian journalist
                            Henry
                            Mayhew's books about the poor.

                            A bombshell hit Romford in the 1830s, with the arrival of the railway. From being a
                            parochial
                            Essex town, slightly cut off, except on market days, Romford now became firmly joined to the
                            rest of Britain and London via the Eastern Counties Railway. One of the main businesses to
                            benefit from the railway was Romford Brewery, which had been founded in 1799. The Brewery
                            closed
                            in 1997, and all that remains is The Brewery Gate, the ground floor being converted into
                            Havering Museum which opened in 2010.

                            Today the Museum can reveal how much more there is in the stories of Romford, Hornchurch,
                            Upminster, Rainham, Havering-atte-Bower and the surrounding areas.

                        <p>
                            The Market began as a sheep market in 1247, with King Henry III granting Romford permission
                            for
                            a weekly market, on a Wednesday, with the addition of a yearly fair from 1250.

                            The Golden Lion Pub that stands at the edge of the Market Place existed in 1440, and still
                            functions today. A largely timber-framed building, it is made up of at least three sections
                            of
                            varying dates, with additions and changes made from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The
                            infamous
                            highwayman Dick Turpin was said to have been a visitor.

                            Church House in the Market Place began as a much larger 15th century building and was used
                            as a
                            chantry priest's house. It was later used as the Cock and Bell Inn, and is rumoured to have
                            a
                            ghost.

                            Sir Francis Bacon, the Elizabethan statesman, philosopher, essayist and author, became
                            landlord
                            of the Golden Lion pub when he inherited it from his father in 1601.

                            Francis Quarles, the Cavalier poet, was born in Romford in 1582. In 1639 he was made city
                            chronologer, a post previously held by Ben Johnson and Thomas Middleton. At the outbreak of
                            the
                            Civil War in 1642, he took the Royalist side and published pamphlets in support of the King.

                            Colonel Thomas Blood (c1618-1680) was born in County Meath, Ireland. A rebel and a
                            republican,
                            his audacious adventures involved him dressing in a variety of disguises. A turncoat and a
                            spy,
                            he is most notorious for attempting to steal the Crown Jewels in 1671, disguised as a
                            parson.
                            Blood and his cohorts were imprisoned briefly in the Tower of London, but curiously he was
                            never
                            actually punished for the crime. Instead, he was rewarded by Charles II with lands in
                            Ireland
                            and a £500 annual pension!

                            Rainham is one of the most significant historic villages in the Havering area. It has roots
                            going back to the Saxon period, and there is important evidence of a settlement from long
                            before
                            that, with a Neolithic site being excavated west of Launders Lane in 1963. There are also
                            remains of a submerged Neolithic forest, which was discovered close to the mouth of the
                            Mardyke
                            River in Rainham marshes.

                            An Anglo-Saxon burial ground from the 6th and 7th centuries was discovered in excavations at
                            Gerpins Pit in 1930. A wealth of items such as swords, brooches, rings, spear heads, and a
                            pair
                            of drinking horns were unearthed, as well as indications of even earlier burials. Evidence
                            of a
                            Roman presence has also been found, with Romano-British pottery shards uncovered at Rainham
                            Ferry, and many Roman artefacts found at the Mardyke Farm Estate in 1963.

                            During the Middle Ages the settlement of Rainham was grouped around the church of St Helen
                            and
                            St Giles and several manor-houses, including Rainham, Berwick, and Gerpins. By the 17th
                            century
                            Rainham Ferry and Rainham Wharf were well established, with goods and passengers coming from
                            London, and the travellers being well provided for by several inns in the area. The 18th
                            century
                            saw increased trade, resulting in several new buildings in the area, most notably Rainham
                            Hall.

                            Rainham had always drawn most of its living from farming, and from the River Thames, and
                            continued to do so into the 20th century, and by 1929 most large farms in the area were
                            known as
                            market gardens. However, the 19th century had brought increased industrialisation in the
                            form of
                            chemical and fertilizer factories at Rainham Ferry. Murex Limited, iron-founders and
                            ferroalloy
                            manufacturers, moved to the area in 1917.

                        <h2>Some People and Places in the Rainham Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            St Helen & St Giles Church is the oldest building in Havering, built c1170, and of much
                            architectural interest. It still has many of its original features, and there is a rare
                            graffito
                            of a medieval ship at anchor on the wall of a stairwell.

                            Richard de Lucy was Chief Judiciary to King Stephen. He was excommunicated by Archbishop of
                            Canterbury Thomas Becket in 1166 and again in 1169. Becket's murder, by the king's henchmen,
                            in
                            1170 resulted in part from his refusal to lift such sentences of excommunication, and it is
                            said
                            that de Lucy founded St Helens & St Giles church in penance for the death.

                            Berwick Manor in Berwick Pond Road, dates from the 17th century. There have been many
                            alterations and additions since. In 1960 it became an old people's home, and in 1970 it
                            became
                            Berwick Manor country club.

                            Captain John Harle, a wealthy London merchant and master mariner who settled in Rainham. He
                            renovated Rainham Wharf, increasing trade with London and abroad. Importing building
                            materials
                            such as timber from Scandinavia, as well as coal, he also advertised granaries for the
                            storage
                            of corn, and shipments to London twice a week. He prospered and had Rainham Hall built in
                            1729.

                            Rainham War Memorial Clock Tower
                            The memorial is a short hexagonal clock tower with faces on three sides. It was built in
                            1920
                            and stands in the centre of the village at Broadway. It now commemorates soldiers killed in
                            both
                            World Wars, as well as civilian casualties of World War II.

                            The name 'Hornchurch' was first recorded in 1222. It is an Anglicised version of the Latin,
                            'Monasterium Cornutum', which roughly translates as 'church with horn like gables'. Although
                            Roman remains, sufficient to prove a settlement, have been found at Mardyke farm in South
                            Hornchurch, the origins of the main village are obscure. It probably dates from Saxon times,
                            and
                            a church, described in charters and legal documents as the 'Ecclesisa de Havering' once
                            occupied
                            the site of the present Church of St Andrew, which dates from the 13th century.

                            This prominent medieval church was once the principal church in Havering. The unusual
                            Highland
                            bulls head on the eastern gable of the chancel was first mentioned in 1824, but 'points of
                            lead
                            fashioned like horns', apparently in the same position, can be traced back to 1610, and
                            could
                            have even earlier origins. By 1384 a bull's head and horns appeared on the seal of the Prior
                            of
                            Hornchurch, and as well as suggesting that the church had horn-like gables, it could also
                            reflect the area's long association with the leather industry.

                            The 'Hornchurch Hoard,' consisting of 448 silver of pennies from around 1223-60 was found by
                            workmen in the Upminster Road, an area within the bounds of the former Hornchurch Priory.
                            They
                            were mostly English coins, struck in the reign of Henry III, with a few contemporary
                            Scottish
                            and Irish coins.

                            At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, Hornchurch was part of the royal manor of
                            Havering,
                            but from the 13th century onwards it became a flourishing community in its own right. There
                            were
                            at least 10 manors, several farms, and a leather industry that lasted over six centuries.
                            The
                            industry supplied work to a large number of people including fellmongers, tanners and
                            skinners,
                            and the goods produced had an outlet at Romford Market.

                            In 1789 the Old Hornchurch Brewery was founded by John Woodfine, supplying the inns in the
                            area.
                            The economy, involving agriculture and small trades and crafts, developed further in the
                            18th
                            century when the Wedlake Brothers, Thomas and Robert, opened an innovative iron foundry in
                            Billet Lane. They specialised in agricultural implements, further serving the economy of the
                            area. Thomas lived opposite the foundry at Fairkytes, and like several other gentlefolk who
                            chose to live locally, built or improved houses in the area.

                        <p>
                            Appleton's alms-houses. In 1586 Jane Ayloffe, a widow, bought a house on the south side of
                            High
                            Street for conversion into 3 alms-houses. The alms-houses were given in trust for the aged
                            poor
                            who had lived in Hornchurch for at least 7 years.

                            Thomas Witherings lived with his wife Dorothy at the large manor house of Great Nelmes. When
                            King Charles opened up the post to the public in 1635 it is believed that Witherings, the
                            Postmaster General, produced the plans for the service, one of the most important
                            developments
                            in the history of Britain's postal service.

                            Alice Aylett made provision in her will of 1731 for the founding of Aylett's school, with
                            funding for a schoolmaster to give tuition to ten poor boys. Prior to this, education in
                            Hornchurch was provided by the local clergy, or by charity schools.

                            Bretons manor house was probably named for the LeBreton family who owned the land here from
                            the
                            12th to the 14th century. Rebuilt in around 1740, it has many of its original features
                            intact.
                            The staircase survives from an earlier Tudor house, and nearby is a brick barn and walled
                            garden
                            that date from the 16th century. There are tales of tunnels, probably of Tudor origin and
                            large
                            enough to take a horse and cart, running from under the house to the river. The purpose of
                            the
                            tunnels is unknown, but they could suggest smuggling activity!

                            Fairkytes house was built in the late 17th century, with additional work being carried out
                            in
                            the 18th and 19th centuries. The first occupant was Job Alibone, whose son Sir Richard
                            Alibone,
                            was the first Catholic to be a Justice of the King's Bench. The Council used Fairkytes as a
                            library from 1953 and since 1972 it has been the home of Havering Arts Centre.

                            Joseph Fry, son of Quaker and prison reformer Elizabeth Fry, lived at Fairkytes house with
                            his
                            wife and children from 1870 until his death in 1896. He, like his mother, engaged in
                            charitable
                            works.

                            Evidence of a Roman settlement, indicative of agricultural and industrial activity in
                            Havering,
                            was unearthed here in the 1970s. Pottery and much building rubble was discovered along with
                            a
                            group cremation burial site, as well as gullies and ditches associated with metal-working.
                            Havering-atte-Bower was one of the three former parishes that from 1465 to 1892 formed the
                            Royal
                            Liberty of Havering, the others being Hornchurch and Romford. In 1272 it is recorded as
                            'Hauering atte Bower', with the suffix meaning 'at the royal residence', and this sparsely
                            populated rural village is steeped in royal history.

                            The first royal palace
                            There may have been a palace in Havering-atte-Bower as early as the seventh century, during
                            Saxon times. It was possibly established by Sigeberht the Little (King of Essex 617-653),

                            was active in this area. It would have been a barn-like building constructed of wood; no
                            indication of its location remains.

                            The second royal palace
                            This palace was likely to have been built by Edward the Confessor (King of England 1042-66)
                            in
                            the middle of the 11th century. Edward the Confessor gave the manor of Havering as a gift to
                            Harold Godwinson, who later succeeded him as King Harold II. When Harold was killed at the
                            Battle of Hastings, the manor passed to the new king, William the Conqueror (r. 1066-87).

                            The third royal palace
                            Henry III (r. 1216-72) greatly remodelled Havering Palace in Kentish rag-stone during the
                            1250s.
                            He then granted the manor of Havering to his wife, Eleanor of Provence, in 1267. Many
                            monarchs
                            and their wives stayed at Havering and several of them made significant alterations to the
                            Palace. Plans of the ground and first floors were drawn up in 1578 by Lord Burghley, Queen
                            Elizabeth I's chief minister.

                            Pyrgo Palace
                            The origins of Pyrgo Palace are unclear. It is commonly thought to have been the dower
                            palace
                            given to the English queens, but there is no written or archaeological evidence to suggest
                            it
                            existed earlier than the late 15th century. It briefly became a royal palace when Henry VIII
                            bought it from Sir Brian Tuke in the mid-1540s, but Elizabeth I gave it away to Sir John
                            Grey in
                            1559. He was the uncle of Lady Jane Grey, the 'Nine Days Queen'.

                        <p>
                            Isabella of Valois was only 7 years old when she married Richard II in 1396, but she was
                            widowed
                            three years later when her husband was dethroned and murdered. She was held at Havering
                            Palace
                            until she was repatriated to France in 1403.

                            Joanna of Navarre, the second wife of Henry IV (r. 1399-1413), was accused of witchcraft,
                            but
                            later pardoned. She died in some disgrace at Havering in 1437, and her ghost is said to
                            haunt
                            the site of the Palace.

                            Edward VI spent most of his childhood at Havering Palace and was often visited by his
                            sisters,
                            the princesses Elizabeth and Mary, and their cousin Lady Jane Grey. Edward became king at
                            the
                            age of 9, and Sir Anthony Cooke of Gidea Hall, notable for his interest in the education of
                            his
                            five daughters as well as his sons, was said to have been a tutor to young Edward. There is
                            no
                            official record of this, and he is more likely to have been a companion and an intellectual
                            guide.

                            Elizabeth I was a frequent visitor to Havering, and is reputed to have stayed in Havering
                            Palace
                            the night before she delivered the 'I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have
                            the
                            heart and stomach of a king' speech at Tilbury in 1588.

                            Dame Anne Tipping, left a bequest for the education of local children, and the village
                            school
                            was founded in 1724, and named for her in honour of the bequest. It was rebuilt in 1837, and
                            the
                            present building dates from 1891.

                            Bower House Orange Tree Hill, is a mansion built in 1729 for John Baynes, Serjeant-at-Law,
                            (a
                            high ranking barrister), using stone quarried from the ruins of Havering Palace, including
                            an
                            angel bust corbel stone bearing the arms of Edward III. It is now a Christian training
                            centre.

                            The Round House on Broxhill Road is a building in Havering of special note. Built in the
                            1790s
                            for wealthy tea merchant William Sheldon, it is said to have been designed in the shape of a
                            tea
                            caddy to commemorate how Sheldon had made his fortune.

                            Elizabeth Balls, born c1761, was one of Havering's most eccentric residents. Also known as
                            'The
                            Goat Woman of Havering-atte-Bower', she shared her home with a herd of goats, a flock of
                            sheep,
                            a few cats, and a dog. No visit to Havering was said to be complete without dropping by to
                            see
                            her, and the animals whom she called 'her dear children'.
